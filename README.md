# MindMark

Bookmark your mind's exact state. The ultimate context-preservation tool.

## Environment Setup

To run this application, you need to set up your Firebase configuration using environment variables.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`).
2. Populate the following variables with your Firebase Web App configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It is already included in `.gitignore`.
